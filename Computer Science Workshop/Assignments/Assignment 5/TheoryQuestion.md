# Theory Part:
- Explain the following concepts:
    + Wrapper Class
        - Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
    + Need for the wrapper class
        -  It is because of the additional features being there in the Wrapper class over the primitive data types when it comes to usage. These methods include primarily methods like valueOf(), parseInt(), toString(), and many more. A wrapper class wraps (encloses) around a data type and gives it an object appearance. Wrapper classes are final and immutable.
    + Different techniques of wrapping
    + Autoboxing
    + Unboxing
- Explain the concept of converting a base data type to an object type(Wrapping) using the valueOf() method.
- Explain the concept of converting object type to base type.
- Explain the method used to do so.
